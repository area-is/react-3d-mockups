/**
 * Where this site lives, for everything that needs an absolute URL: canonical

 *
 * ⚠️ SET THIS FOR THE REAL DEPLOYMENT. Nothing else in the repo records the
 * production URL, so the fallback below is a placeholder built from the Worker
 * name in `wrangler.jsonc`. Point it at the actual origin (a custom domain if
 * there is one) by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` as a *build* variable
 * (Workers & Pages → area-3d-mockups-docs → Settings → Build → Variables),
 * because `metadataBase` is baked in at build time, not read at runtime.
 *
 * Getting it wrong is not fatal but is visible: social cards would point their
 * image at a host that does not serve it, and canonical links would name the
 * wrong origin.

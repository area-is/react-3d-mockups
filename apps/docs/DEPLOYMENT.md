The site is served at a **path on the apex** rather than on its own hostname.
That is two changes that have to land together, and the code half is done:
this file records what is in place, and what a human still has to do in the
Cloudflare dashboard.

## Why it is not just a routing change

A hostname binding gives the Worker an entire origin: every request to
`3d-mockups.area.is` reaches it, so the app can serve from `/` and emit
root-absolute URLs (`/docs`, `/_next/static/…`, `/thumbs/ipad-pro-13.png`) that
all land back on itself.

Under `area.is/react-3d-mockups` the Worker sees **only** requests beginning
with that prefix. Every root-absolute URL the app emits now points at the
apex's root - somebody else's site - and 404s. So the routing change has to be
matched by teaching the app that it lives under a prefix, which in Next.js is
`basePath`.

## Part 1 - Cloudflare

### A Custom Domain cannot do this

Workers **Custom Domains** bind a whole hostname and have no path component -
which is what `3d-mockups.area.is` is. A path prefix must be a **Route**:

| | Custom Domain | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Path | whole hostname only | pattern with a path |
| DNS | creates its own record | needs an existing **proxied** record |
| Certificate | issued for you | uses the zone's |

A route is only consulted for requests Cloudflare is already terminating:
"all domains and subdomains must have a DNS record to be proxied on Cloudflare
and used to invoke a Worker."

### The apex record — ✅ done

`area.is` had no `A`, `AAAA` or `CNAME` at all (`NODATA`), and `www.area.is`
did not exist. The zone was already on Cloudflare, so there was nothing to
migrate - there was simply nothing at the apex to attach a route to.

It now carries a proxied placeholder:

| Type | Name | IPv6 address | Proxy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AAAA` | `@` | `100::` | Proxied (orange) |

`100::` is the RFC 6666 discard prefix, the conventional Cloudflare black
hole. With it in place `area.is/react-3d-mockups*` reaches this Worker and
every other apex path errors, there being no origin behind it yet - which is
the correct state for an apex that is not live. **Swap it for the real record
when the Next.js apex app ships; keep it proxied.** Grey-cloud it and this
Worker stops being reachable at that path.

### The routes — ✅ done, in `wrangler.jsonc`

```jsonc
"routes": [
  { "pattern": "area.is/react-3d-mockups", "zone_name": "area.is" },
  { "pattern": "area.is/react-3d-mockups/*", "zone_name": "area.is" }
]
```

Kept in the config rather than clicked into the dashboard, so the binding is
reviewable and redeployable. Two patterns, not one `…/react-3d-mockups*`: a
single trailing wildcard would also swallow `/react-3d-mockups-anything-else`.
Add `www.area.is/react-3d-mockups…` as well if `www` is ever served rather
than redirected.

### Precedence over whatever serves the apex

Routes match most-specific-first - Cloudflare's own example is that
`example.com/hello/*` takes precedence over `example.com/*` - so these win
over a broader `area.is/*`. The same holds against a Custom Domain, which is a
whole-hostname binding with no path: the route is matched first, and the
route's Worker can even `fetch(request)` through to the Worker on the Custom
Domain. A Worker route likewise wins over a Cloudflare Pages project on the
same hostname.

None of that is automatic in the other direction. **Whoever sets up the apex
app must leave this route alone and keep the apex record proxied.** A Custom
Domain on `area.is` is fine; deleting the route, or grey-clouding the apex, is
what breaks this.

### Where the apex app is hosted decides whether this works at all

| The apex app runs on | Apex DNS | Does the route fire? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloudflare Workers (OpenNext, like this one) | its Custom Domain, proxied | **Yes** |
| Cloudflare Pages | proxied, managed by Pages | **Yes** |
| Vercel / Netlify / any external origin | must be **proxied** (orange) | **Only if proxied.** Grey-cloud is what those platforms recommend, and it bypasses Workers entirely - the route never runs |

That last row is the trap. If `area.is` ends up on Vercel with a DNS-only
record, this whole arrangement is inert, and the alternative is to let the
apex app own the path instead - a Next.js `rewrite` from
`/react-3d-mockups/:path*` to this Worker's own hostname. That works from any
host, at the cost of a proxy hop and of making this site's availability depend
on the apex app's.

## Part 2 - the app — ✅ done

### One prefix, one place

`lib/base-path.mjs` holds `BASE_PATH` and an `asset()` helper. Plain `.mjs`
with no imports, because `next.config.ts`, the build scripts and the client
components all read it and have no other module format in common. It is a
literal rather than an environment variable on purpose: `basePath` is inlined
into the client bundle at build time and cannot be switched at runtime, so a
variable would only create the illusion that it could be.

`next.config.ts` feeds it to Next as `basePath`, which rewrites everything
Next itself emits: `next/link` hrefs, router navigations, `/_next/*` assets,
route handlers.

Two things it was worth checking by hand, and both are fine. `usePathname()`
returns the path **without** the prefix (app-router resolves it as
`hasBasePath(p) ? removeBasePath(p) : p`), so the `/docs/api/<id>` comparisons
in `components/mockup-breadcrumb.tsx` and `lib/sidebar-tree.ts` keep working
untouched. And `metadataBase` keeps its own path when it resolves a relative
one - Next joins them - so the social card comes out at
`https://area.is/react-3d-mockups/og.png`.

### What `basePath` does not reach

Anything the repo hard-codes as a root-absolute string is invisible to it.
Every one of these now goes through `asset()`:

1. **Sidebar thumbnails.** `thumb` in `lib/mockup-catalog.mjs`, rendered by
   `components/docs-sidebar.tsx` as a plain `<img>`. (`href` in the same
   catalog must **not** be prefixed - it is fed to `<Link>`, which adds the
   prefix itself, and `sidebar-tree.ts` compares against it unprefixed.)
2. **Every `<img>` in the artwork** - thirteen of them across
   `image-demo.tsx`, `surface-art.tsx`, `carton-art.tsx`, `package-art.tsx`,
   `device-apps.tsx`, `book-jacket.tsx` and `record-sleeve.tsx`. None goes
   through `next/image`, so none of them was prefixed for us.
3. **Search.** `fumadocs-core`'s fetch client defaults its endpoint to
   `join(BASE_PATH, '/api/search')`, where that `BASE_PATH` comes from
   `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` - a Vite variable, undefined under Next - so it
   resolved to a bare `/api/search`. `app/docs/layout.tsx` now points it
   explicitly.
4. **`robots.txt`.** Prefixed *inside the file*, because a robots.txt path is
   resolved against the origin root and never against `basePath`. Note that
   `app/robots.ts` is **not** the file that governs this site: crawlers only
   read `https://area.is/robots.txt`, which this Worker never sees. It is kept
   as the written record of the rules, and because it is correct to paste
   straight into the apex's own robots.txt.
5. **The screenshot scripts.** `visual-check.mjs` and `generate-thumbs.mjs`
   request `${BASE}/harness?…`; their default base now carries the prefix, so
   `npm run visual` and `npm run thumbs` work with no extra flags. Both still
   take `--base` for anything else. (`generate-thumbs.mjs` writes to
   `public/thumbs/` through its own constant, so the prefixed `thumb` value
   does not move its output.)

`lib/site.ts` carries the production URL as its fallback, prefix included, so
a plain checkout builds correct canonicals with nothing set in the dashboard.
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` still overrides it, and still has to be a **build**
variable.

### What the build looks like afterwards

`.open-next/assets` is now nested under `react-3d-mockups/`, so Workers Assets
serves `/react-3d-mockups/_next/static/…`, `/art/…` and `/thumbs/…` straight
off the edge under exactly the paths the routes match.

## Part 3 - what is left to do

Steps 1 and 2 are the two ✅ sections above. The rest needs a human with
Cloudflare access:

3. **Deploy** with the routes in place and the old Custom Domain **still
   there**. Both URLs now serve; the old one is the fallback.
4. **Verify** `https://area.is/react-3d-mockups` in a clean browser profile.
   Watch the network panel for 404s on `/_next/*`, `/thumbs/*` and
   `/api/search` - those are the three a missed prefix shows up as. Workers &
   Pages → `area-3d-mockups-docs` → Settings → Domains & Routes shows the
   Custom Domain and the new routes side by side, so you can confirm the
   routes registered before touching anything.
5. **Remove the Custom Domain** from that same screen. Its DNS row is locked
   and managed by the Custom Domain, so it disappears on its own - do not try
   to delete it from the DNS tab.

   No redirect, and no placeholder record behind it: this project has no users
   on `3d-mockups.area.is`, so there is nothing to carry across. If that ever
   stops being true, the redirect needs a **proxied** record left on the old
   hostname, because a Redirect Rule only runs if Cloudflare terminates the
   request.

The `*.workers.dev` URLs serve the site too and are toggled separately, if you
eventually want exactly one address.

## Things that change quietly

- **Origin.** The site now shares `https://area.is` with everything else on
  the apex: same cookie jar, same `localStorage`, same service-worker scope. If
  the apex app sets cookies at the apex, this app sends them on every request.
- **Search Console.** `area.is/react-3d-mockups` is a URL-prefix property, not
  a domain property.

 * Every variant is its own page so the sidebar grid can highlight exactly the
 * model you are reading - a family page would light up all four iPhones at
 * once. The pages are generated rather than hand-written because the API
 * reference below the explorer is shared by a whole family: it lives once, in
 * content/family-reference/<family>.mdx, and is composed into each of that
 * family's pages here. Edit the shared file, re-run this, commit the result.
 *
 * Object mockups are 1:1 with their pages already, so they are untouched.

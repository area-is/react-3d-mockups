/**
 * The hero carousel: ONE WebGL canvas holding every model on show.
 *
 * Each `*Mockup` component is a canvas plus an object, which is the right
 * shape for a page that shows one device - but a carousel of them would mean
 * a context per slot, and three at once was already enough to get one dropped
 * ("THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost"). So this composes the bare objects
 * (`<Galaxy>`, `<Laptop>`, `<MilkCarton>`, …) into a single `<MockupCanvas>`
 * and moves them through the scene instead: the models on the stage and the
 * picker row beneath it are all real geometry in the same context, none of
 * them screenshots, and adding a slot costs geometry rather than a context.
 *
 * What is on show is a spread, not a catalog: ONE model per device family
 * (the four iPhone variants and five iPads all look alike at this size, and
 * scrolling past them read as padding) plus the print and packaging objects,
 * which are what say the library is not only about phones.
 *
 * Sizing comes from the library's own framing data. A mockup frames its object
 * by placing the camera at a per-family distance, so an object that looks right
 * at distance `d` in its own canvas looks the same here when scaled by
 * `CAMERA_Z / d` - phones, laptops, monitors and milk cartons end up optically
 * matched without a table of hand-tuned scales.

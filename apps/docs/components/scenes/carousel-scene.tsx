 * The hero carousel: ONE WebGL canvas holding every model on show.

 * shape for a page that shows one device - but a carousel of them would mean
 * a context per slot, and three at once was already enough to get one dropped
 * ("THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost"). So this composes the bare objects
 * (`<Galaxy>`, `<Laptop>`, `<MilkCarton>`, …) into a single `<MockupCanvas>`
 * and moves them through the scene instead: the models on the stage and the
 * picker row beneath it are all real geometry in the same context, none of
 * them screenshots, and adding a slot costs geometry rather than a context.
 *
 * What is on show is a spread, not a catalog: ONE model per device family
 * (the four iPhone variants and five iPads all look alike at this size, and
 * scrolling past them read as padding) plus the print and packaging objects,
 * which are what say the library is not only about phones.
 *
 * Every model is sized to the same box (`STAGE_HEIGHT` by `STAGE_WIDTH`) from

 * A model's size and centre at unit scale, in the rig's units - measured, once
 * per id, from the geometry it actually renders.
 *
 * Sizing used to come from the library's framing data: each family's camera
 * distance, scaled to this one. That matches a model to its own docs page,
 * which is the wrong comparison on a stage where they stand in a row. A
 * MacBook framed to fill its own canvas covered two thirds of the area of the
 * iPad after it, the shopping bag's handles reached up into the swatches, and
 * a laptop, whose origin is its hinge, needed a hand-set nudge to sit level
 * with the rest. Measured bounds fit every model into the same box and centre
 * it on what is drawn, and a bus or a billboard needs no hand-tuned scale to
 * join them.
 *
 * `Box3.setFromObject` reads each mesh's bounding box, which three caches on
 * the geometry, so this is a walk over a few hundred boxes the first frame a
 * model exists and a map lookup after. It runs inside the slot's frame
 * callback, before that frame renders, so the model is never drawn at the
 * wrong size.

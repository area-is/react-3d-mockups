 * Every indexable route.
 *
 * The ~50 per-mockup API pages are the reason this file exists: they are
 * deliberately kept out of the sidebar tree and are only reachable through
 * client-rendered grids, so a crawler following links alone finds few of them.
 * `source.getPages()` enumerates them from the same content collection the
 * pages themselves are built from, so the sitemap cannot drift.
 *
 * `/harness` and `/embedded` are excluded here and disallowed in robots.ts -
 * they are tooling and an iframe target, not pages.

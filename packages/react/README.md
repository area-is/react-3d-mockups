# react-3d-mockups

GPU-accelerated **3D device mockups for React**. Put any content on the screen of a 3D
device - real DOM, projected onto WebGL glass, so it stays live: text is vector crisp at
any angle, videos play, iframes load, React state and effects keep running. Mockups are
decorative: you rotate and zoom them, and the hardware masks the screen pixel for pixel
([why](#screens-are-display-only)).

- **Twenty-two devices** - the Galaxy S26 line (S26, S26 Ultra), the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and
  Z Flip 7 foldables, the full iPhone 17 family (17, 17 Air, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max), MacBook
  Air 13"/15" and MacBook Pro 14"/16" (M5), iPad Pro 13"/11" (M5), iPad Air 13"/11" (M4),
  iPad (A16), Galaxy Tab S11 / S11 Ultra, an Apple Watch Series 11 and Galaxy Watch 8 on
  full wristbands, and a Studio Display-style 27" monitor, all procedurally generated
  at runtime. No GLB files, no
  hosting, no pop-in - importing one mockup costs 7.4–48.8 KB gzipped (the whole
  library: 103.8 KB), peers excluded. The phone, foldable, and
  laptop families carry a small CSG engine that machines their ports and speaker/mic
  holes into the chassis as real cavities; it tree-shakes away for every other mockup.
- **True-to-device screens** - each virtual display matches the real device's logical
  resolution in portrait *and* landscape (table below), so your layouts and breakpoints
  behave exactly like on the hardware.
- **Real GPU rendering** - three.js + react-three-fiber, physically-based materials, studio
  lighting, soft shadows, clamped DPR.
- **Any content on screen** - pass React components, an `<iframe>` or a `<video>` as
  children. State, effects and media playback keep running, and every surface is masked
  per-pixel by the hardware in front of it.
- **Composable** - use the one-liners `<GalaxyMockup>` / `<IPhoneMockup>` / `<LaptopMockup>`
  / `<IPadMockup>` / `<GalaxyTabMockup>` / `<AppleWatchMockup>` / `<GalaxyWatchMockup>` / `<StudioDisplayMockup>`, or
  drop `<Galaxy>` / `<IPhone>` / `<Laptop>` / `<IPad>` / `<GalaxyTab>` / `<AppleWatch>` / `<GalaxyWatch>` /
  `<StudioDisplay>` into your own react-three-fiber scene.

## Install

```bash
npm install react-3d-mockups three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
```

React 19+ (react-three-fiber 9 and drei 10 both require it). `three` 0.179+,
`@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` are
**peer** dependencies rather than bundled ones, because each has to exist exactly once in
an app - two copies of `three` mean two different `THREE.Mesh` classes, so `instanceof`
checks and r3f's element catalogue stop matching.

npm 7+ and pnpm 8+ install peers automatically, so `npm install react-3d-mockups` alone
already pulls all three in. Listing them explicitly still records them in your
`package.json`, which is what you want if you import from `three` yourself. Yarn does not
auto-install peers, so there the full command is required.

## Quick start

```tsx
'use client'

import { GalaxyMockup } from 'react-3d-mockups'

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 560 }}>
      <GalaxyMockup autoRotate float>
        <YourApp />
      </GalaxyMockup>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Drag anywhere - body, background, or the screen itself - to orbit. In Next.js, load it
client-side only (`dynamic(() => import('./mockup'), { ssr: false })`).

## Regions & slots

Bare children always fill a mockup's **primary region** (a phone's screen, a book's
cover). Objects with more printable surfaces expose each one as a **compound slot** -
type `AFrameSignMockup.` and your editor lists exactly the regions the object has:

```tsx
<AFrameSignMockup autoRotate>
  <AFrameSignMockup.Front>
    <MenuBoard />
  </AFrameSignMockup.Front>
  <AFrameSignMockup.Back surfaceBackground="#20241f" resolution={640}>
    <HoursBoard />
  </AFrameSignMockup.Back>
</AFrameSignMockup>
```

A slot takes the same three surface settings a mockup does - `surfaceBackground`,
`resolution`, `surfaceStyle` - and overrides the mockup's for that one region. One
vocabulary, whichever element you hang it off. Every surface has a name, so content
lands where the name says no matter what order you write the slots in:

```tsx
<BrochureMockup>
  <BrochureMockup.FrontLeft><Cover /></BrochureMockup.FrontLeft>
  <BrochureMockup.FrontCenter><Middle /></BrochureMockup.FrontCenter>
  <BrochureMockup.BackLeft><Map /></BrochureMockup.BackLeft>
</BrochureMockup>
```

The same slots exist on the raw scene components (`<AFrameSign.Front>` inside your own
r3f scene). Slots must be direct children of their mockup (fragments are fine); region
names come from each object's spec in the core.

## Components

### `<GalaxyMockup>` / `<IPhoneMockup>` / `<LaptopMockup>` / `<IPadMockup>` / `<GalaxyTabMockup>` / `<AppleWatchMockup>` / `<GalaxyWatchMockup>` / `<StudioDisplayMockup>` - all-in-one

Every device appearance prop, plus `float` (idle floating animation) and the staging
props from `<MockupCanvas>`: `controls`, `autoRotate`, `zoom`,
`fullscreen`, `shadows`, `background`, `camera`, `className`, `style`. The three canvas
props marked *canvas only* below tune the renderer rather than the picture and stay on
`<MockupCanvas>`. Transforms are first-class: `position`, `rotation` and `scale` flow
straight through to the device group (`<IPhoneMockup rotation={[0, 0.25, 0]}>`).

### `<MockupCanvas>` - the stage

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `controls` | `boolean` | `true` | Drag-to-orbit controls |
| `freeRotation` | `boolean` | `false` | Allow full 360° vertical rotation (straight over the top); off = classic clamped orbit. Canvas only |
| `autoRotate` | `boolean \| number` | `false` | Slowly orbit the camera. `true` is one revolution a minute; a number multiplies that (`autoRotate={2}` twice as fast) |
| `zoom` | `boolean` | `false` | Scroll/pinch zoom (off so pages don't lose scroll) |
| `shadows` | `boolean` | `true` | Soft contact shadow |
| `shadowY` | `number` | `-2.05` | Y of the shadow plane (grounds the device). Canvas only - a mockup derives it from the object's framing |
| `background` | `string` | - | CSS background of the canvas |
| `camera` | r3f camera | `[0, 0.5, 7.4]`, fov 40 | Camera override |
| `dpr` | `number \| [min, max]` | `[1, 2]` | Device-pixel-ratio clamp. Canvas only |

### `<Galaxy>` - the device

Render inside any r3f `<Canvas>`. Accepts all group props (`position`, `rotation`, `scale`…).

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Screen content |
| `color` | `string` | `'#101216'` | Back panel, and the whole finish - the frame, buttons and camera rings follow from it. A retail colorway id from `GALAXY_COLORWAYS` (`'icyblue'`…) brings that model's measured metal; any other CSS color gets metal derived from it |
| `surfaceBackground` | `string` | `'#000000'` | CSS background behind your content |
| `variant` | `'s26' \| 's26ultra'` | `'s26'` | Which Galaxy S26-family device (true relative sizes + per-model cameras) |
| `orientation` | `'portrait' \| 'landscape'` | `'portrait'` | Landscape lays the device sideways and swaps the virtual display |
| `resolution` | `number` | per variant | Virtual display width in CSS px (see resolution table) |
| `surfaceStyle` | `CSSProperties` | - | Extra styles for the screen wrapper |

### `<IPhone>` - iPhone 17 family

Same API as `<Galaxy>`, except: `variant` is `'17' | 'air' | 'pro' | 'promax'`, and
`resolution` defaults to the variant's logical point grid (see resolution table). Camera architecture follows the real devices: two-lens
pill (17), ultra-thin single-lens bar (Air), full-width triple-lens plateau with flash +
LiDAR (Pro / Pro Max).

### `<Laptop>` - MacBook Air 13" / MacBook Pro 14" (M5)-style

Same screen API (`surfaceBackground`, `resolution`, `surfaceStyle`), plus
`openAngle` (lid angle, default `110`), and `resolution`
defaulting to the variant's scaled desktop (Air 1280×832, Pro 14 1512×982 - desktop breakpoints
apply). `color` sets the aluminum finish - a `LAPTOP_COLORWAYS` id (`'skyblue'`,
`'starlight'`, `'midnight'`) or any CSS color.

## Screens are display-only

Content on the glass renders live, but pointer events never reach it: clicks,
scrolling and typing all belong to the orbit controls, so a drag anywhere -
body, background, or screen - rotates the model.

That is deliberate, and it is what buys the mockup its looks. A screen is real
DOM composited into a WebGL scene, and where that DOM sits in the stacking
order decides how hardware can hide it. react-3d-mockups always stacks it *under*
the canvas and masks it with the depth buffer, so anything in front of the
screen covers it exactly, pixel for pixel: a laptop's keyboard hides the
screen's reflection, a proud camera ring stands over a wrap, a bus's mirrors
draw over the livery.

Lifting the DOM above the canvas is the only way to make it clickable, and it
costs exactly that masking - nothing in the scene can visually cover DOM that
sits on top of it. Hiding degrades to an all-or-nothing guess from sample rays,
which is wrong in both directions: content shows through hardware that should
hide it, and a mostly-visible screen can blank out entirely. Mockups exist to
look right, so that trade is not offered.

If you need a genuinely usable embedded app, render it in the page next to the
mockup rather than on it.

## Virtual screen resolutions

Every variant's screen defaults to the real device's logical resolution (CSS px):

| Device | `variant` | Portrait | Landscape | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Galaxy S26 | `s26` | 360×780 | 780×360 | 2340×1080 panel at ⅓ (3x) |
| Galaxy S26 Ultra | `s26ultra` | 384×833 | 833×384 | One UI default FHD+ render @ 450 dpi |
| Galaxy Z Fold 7 (open / folded) | `fold7` | 820×910 / 360×835 | swapped | inner 2184×1968, cover 2520×1080 |
| Galaxy Z Flip 7 (open / folded) | `flip7` | 360×838 / 316×349 | swapped | main 2520×1080, cover 948×1048 |
| iPhone 17 | `17` | 402×874 | 874×402 | 2622×1206 @ 3x point grid |
| iPhone 17 Air | `air` | 420×912 | 912×420 | 2736×1260 @ 3x point grid |

| MacBook Pro 14" (M5) | `pro14` | - | 1512×982 | 3024×1964 @ 2x default scaled |
| MacBook Pro 16" (M5) | `pro16` | - | 1728×1117 | 3456×2234 @ 2x default scaled |
| iPad Pro 13" (M5) | `ipadpro13` | 1032×1376 | 1376×1032 | 2752×2064 @ 2x point grid |
| iPad Pro 11" (M5) | `ipadpro11` | 834×1210 | 1210×834 | 2420×1668 @ 2x point grid |
| iPad Air 13" (M4) | `ipadair13` | 1024×1366 | 1366×1024 | 2732×2048 @ 2x point grid |
| iPad Air 11" (M4) | `ipadair11` | 820×1180 | 1180×820 | 2360×1640 @ 2x point grid |
| iPad (A16) | `ipad11` | 820×1180 | 1180×820 | 2360×1640 @ 2x point grid |
| Galaxy Tab S11 | `tabs11` | 800×1280 | 1280×800 | 2560×1600 panel at ½ (xhdpi) |

| Apple Watch Series 11 46mm | `series11` | 208×248 | - | 416×496 @ 2x point grid |
| Galaxy Watch 8 44mm | `watch8` | 240×240 | - | 480×480 round panel at ½ |
| Studio Display 27" | - | - | 2560×1440 | 5120×2880 @ 2x point grid |

### `<IPad>` / `<GalaxyTab>` - the iPad lineup / Galaxy Tab S11 family

Shares the phones' screen/interaction API plus `orientation`, with a `variant` prop
(`'ipadpro13' | 'ipadpro11' | 'ipadair13' | 'ipadair11' | 'ipad11' | 'tabs11' |
'tabs11ultra'`). Fully procedural and per-variant accurate: the Pro's camera pod
(wide lens, LiDAR, flash) and Pencil charging window, the Air's and standard iPad's
bare single lens with the Touch ID top button, back or edge Smart Connector dots and
speaker drill rows; protruding camera rings, quad speaker slots, gold pogo contacts
and (on the Ultra) the U-shaped display notch on the Galaxy Tabs; brand marks as real
vector geometry (Apple glyph, edge-aligned SAMSUNG wordmark) and model wordmarks on
the backs; landscape-edge front cameras, USB-C and machined edge buttons on all.

### `<AppleWatch>` / `<GalaxyWatch>` - smartwatches · `<StudioDisplay>` - Studio Display-style

Both watches add `bandColor` and skip orientation. Every device draws its front camera unconditionally - a punch hole, Dynamic Island or notch is hardware, and it obstructs your layout here exactly as it would on the real panel. `<AppleWatch>` is the Series 11:
squircle case, knurled Digital Crown, flush side button, sensor back, worn on the
seamless Solo Loop - which has no closure, so it takes no `bandOpen`.
`<GalaxyWatch>` is the Watch 8: cushion case, round display on its dial puck, two
flat keys, BioActive puck, worn on a buckled two-strap band that `bandOpen` lays
out flat. The monitor puts the
2026 Studio Display's 27" 5K panel on its tilt stand - uniform bezel, centered
camera, the tight rear 2× Thunderbolt 5 + 2× USB-C slot cluster, the captive power
cord's circular recess framed by the stand's cable hole and, faithfully, no power
button.

Renderer-agnostic device specs (`GALAXY_VARIANTS`, `IPHONE_VARIANTS`, `IPAD_VARIANTS`,
`APPLE_WATCH_VARIANTS`, `GALAXY_WATCH_VARIANTS`,
`PHONE`, `IPHONE`, `LAPTOP`… plus each object's region registry and stage framing) are
available from the `react-3d-mockups/core` subpath. It carries no `'use client'`
directive, so a server component can import a spec for layout math.

## Architecture

`react-3d-mockups` is one package in two layers. All device/object specs, region
registries, stage framing, geometry math and shared screen/stage behaviors live in a
renderer-agnostic core that depends on `three` and never on React; the components are
the layer that renders it through react-three-fiber.

The main entry re-exports a curated slice of the core (variants, colorways, size
types); the full core surface is available from `react-3d-mockups/core`, which carries
no `'use client'` directive so a server component can import a spec for layout math.
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/area-is/3d-mockups/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md)
for the layering rule.

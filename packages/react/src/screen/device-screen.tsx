 * z-index alone - the DOM is what you actually see through the hole the depth
 * mask cuts, so two overlapping screens stack by z-index, not by the depth
 * buffer. A greeting card's cover and its inside face are ~25 mm apart in a
 * 1000-unit frustum; on drei's default band both rounded to the same integer
 * and the inside face painted straight over the cover. A million steps
 * resolves a few thousandths of a unit, which is finer than any two surfaces

 *
 * It has to be the element holding BOTH, so it is derived as their nearest

 * is sealed into a subtree whose own z-index is `auto`, while the screens,
 * sitting outside it with a z-index in the millions, calmly layer over it:
 * every screen paints over the hardware from every angle.
 *
 * The ancestor is re-derived every frame and the isolation MOVES with it,

 * `portal ?? events.connected ?? gl.domElement.parentNode`, and on a busy
 * commit `events.connected` can still be unset, so the first frames put the
 * screen INSIDE the canvas's own container. Isolate that and leave it
 * isolated, and once r3f connects and drei re-portals the screen out to the

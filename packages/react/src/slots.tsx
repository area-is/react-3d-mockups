/**
 * Compound-slot machinery: how a mockup's regions become child elements.
 *
 * Region names come from the object's spec in `src/core`
 * (`A_FRAME_SIGN_REGIONS` → `<AFrameSign.Front>` / `<AFrameSign.Back>`). Slot
 * components render nothing themselves - the parent mockup collects them from
 * its children with `collectSlots` and feeds each region's content and
 * per-surface settings into the matching `DeviceScreen`.
 *
 * Bare (non-slot) children are shorthand for the primary region - the first
 * region in the spec's list - so the single-surface one-liner stays a
 * one-liner: `<GalaxyMockup><App/></GalaxyMockup>`.
 *
 * Slots must be DIRECT children of the mockup (fragments are flattened). A
 * user component that merely renders a slot element cannot be detected - the
 * slot then renders in place and warns instead of disappearing silently.

 * the CANVAS's CSS - its page background and its wrapper styles - so a screen's
 * equivalents have to be named apart from them, and naming them apart at only
 * one of the two levels is how `style` ends up meaning two different things
 * depending on which element you hang it off.

 *   app, not content. Left exposed it read as page content: demo headings
 *   landed in the document outline (a home page grew three `<h1>`s), a mock
 *   status bar's "9:41" was announced, and a newspaper on a tablet became the
 *   page's main `<article>` for reader modes and crawlers.
 * - `'visible'`: the screen's DOM is left in the accessibility tree, for a
 *   screen that carries text found nowhere else on the page.

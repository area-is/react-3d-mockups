// react-3d-mockups/core - the renderer-agnostic heart of the library.
//
// Device/object specs, region registries, framing, geometry math, and the
// screen & stage behaviors. Everything here depends on `three` at most and
// never on React: the components are a thin layer that feeds this data into
// react-three-fiber. Keeping the dependency one-way is what makes the numbers
// testable without a renderer - the unit tests in `__tests__` need no DOM, no
// WebGL and no React.
//
// This file is also the package's second entry point, published as the
// `react-3d-mockups/core` subpath, so specs can be imported without pulling in
// the components:
//
//   import { IPHONE_VARIANTS, STUDIO_LIGHTFORMERS } from 'react-3d-mockups/core'
//
// It carries no 'use client' directive, unlike the main entry - a server
// component can import a spec for layout math. See ARCHITECTURE.md at the repo
// root.

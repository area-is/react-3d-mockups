/**
 * Milk carton object dimensions - a gable-top beverage carton.
 *
 * Proportions follow the US half-gallon (1.89 L) carton: a 95 x 95 mm square
 * footprint, 241 mm tall overall - 190 mm of walls, a roof whose ridge rises
 * 38 mm above them, and the 13 mm sealed fin standing on the ridge.
 * Normalized to ~55 mm per world unit so the carton is 4.4 units tall.
 *
 * The top is the shape the pack is named for: two slanted roof panels meeting
 * at a ridge, an ear fold closing each end, and the fin the four panels are
 * pinched into. The ear folds are why the ends are not flat triangles - a side
 * panel stays its full width as it rises while the roof narrows toward the
 * ridge, so the excess board folds inward - deepening the whole way up until
 * the two halves close on each other just under the fin, where they are
 * pinched flat and sealed into it. A ribbed screw cap sits on the front roof
 * panel, which is where a real carton puts it - so it rides over that panel's
 * artwork the way a real spout rides over the print.
 *
 * Live faces: the four wall panels (front is the primary region) plus both
 * roof panels.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.

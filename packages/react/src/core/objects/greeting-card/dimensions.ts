/**
 * Greeting card object dimensions - a folded A7 card standing like a tent.
 *
 * Proportions follow the US A7 standard: a 10" x 7" sheet folded once into
 * two 127 x 178 mm portrait panels on heavy card stock, standing partially
 * open. Normalized to ~56 mm per world unit (the book's scale) so the card
 * stands 3.18 units tall.
 *
 * Four printable faces: the front cover, the two inside faces of the spread,
 * and the back cover.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.

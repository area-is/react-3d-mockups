 * riveted cargo box in one tall shell, with a stub clamshell hood, cowl
 * break, raked two-piece windshield, crowned roof, dual rear wheels, a
 * roll-up rear door and flat cargo sides that take a vinyl-wrap livery.
 *
 * Normalized to ~1050 mm per world unit: 5.9 m long, 2.55 m tall, 2.05 m wide
 * becomes 5.62 x 2.43 x 1.95 units. The group origin sits mid-height at the
 * body center; the ground plane is `groundY` below it. +X is the nose, +Z the
 * curb side carrying the live wrap panel.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a

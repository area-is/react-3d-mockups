/**
 * TV object dimensions - three premium flat-screen designs, each sized by its
 * diagonal in inches (default 65").
 *
 * The variants are proportioned from the published dimensions of current
 * Samsung and LG sets, which is what makes them read as different products
 * rather than one cabinet with different legs:
 *
 * - `legs` - the wide-set 4K class on splayed A-frame feet: a near-bezel-less
 *   panel (~7.6 mm frame, ~14.6 mm bottom chin), thin at the edges with a
 *   shallow electronics bulge low on the back, standing on two slim feet near
 *   the ends, each a pair of struts meeting at the cabinet in the shallow Λ of
 *   current retail stands.
 * - `pedestal` - the Neo QLED class on a center plate, from Samsung's own
 *   QN70F spec sheet (75": 1677.5 x 960.7 x 26.6 mm over a 1660.6 x 934.1 mm
 *   panel, so an 8.45 mm frame and an 18.15 mm chin on a 26.6 mm AirSlim slab;
 *   the AERO CENTER stand's footprint is 354.8 x 331.5 mm, and the 1017.5 mm
 *   height-with-stand puts the panel 56.8 mm up). Samsung publishes that
 *   footprint at four sizes, so the plate is interpolated between them rather
 *   than scaled off one.
 * - `frame` - the picture-frame class (Samsung The Frame LS03F, 65":
 *   1458 x 833 x 25.4 mm over the same panel, i.e. a UNIFORM ~14.75 mm bezel
 *   with no chin, and a slab of even thickness because the electronics live in
 *   an external One Connect box). It ships with the Slim Fit Wall Mount and
 *   hangs flush, so it stands on nothing: the panel meets the surface directly.
 *   Its back is the matte-black ribbed skin of Samsung's own rear photography,
 *   whatever the bezel finish: a lower cover band with a seam the One Connect
 *   cable runs along, the connector recess standing up from that seam, and
 *   the VESA points either side of it.
 *
 * Normalized to ~258 mm per world unit (the 65" panel is 5.6 units wide). The
 * origin is the panel center; the media-stand plane is `standHeight` below it.
 *
 * Sizing follows real product ranges rather than uniform scaling: the panel
 * scales with the diagonal, but bezels, cabinet depth and port hardware stay
 * physical, feet keep a near-constant inset from the panel ends (they bolt into
 * the corner structure), and the stand hardware grows only mildly across the
 * range.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and
 * a future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.

/**
 * Watch device dimensions - the Apple Watch Series 11 and the Samsung Galaxy
 * Watch 8, Watch 9 and Watch Ultra 2.
 *
 * All variants share one world scale (~17.7 mm per unit) so they keep true
 * relative sizes side by side:
 *
 * - Apple Watch Series 11, 46 mm: 46 x 39 x 9.7 mm squircle case, ~1.96"
 *   416x496 wide-angle OLED with heavily rounded corners. Right edge, top to
 *   bottom (per Apple's product photography): knurled Digital Crown (~7.3 mm
 *   gear-toothed barrel with a flat end cap, protruding ~2 mm), a single
 *   microphone hole, then the elongated flush side button sitting in a
 *   machined recess below center. Left edge: a fine perforated speaker
 *   grille. The Solo Loop slides into dark band slots in the case's flat
 *   top/bottom edges, offset toward the case back.
 * - Galaxy Watch 8, 44 mm: 46.0 x 43.7 x 8.6 mm "cushion" case (squircle
 *   aluminum armor with a flat top) carrying a RAISED round dial - the fully
 *   round 1.47" 480x480 sAMOLED sits on a slightly protruding black puck, so
 *   the aluminum cushion stays visible around it (unlike the Apple's
 *   edge-to-edge crystal). Right edge (per GSMArena's review macros): two
 *   raised pill keys with chamfered edges straddling a tiny microphone hole
 *   at center. Left edge: two short machined speaker slots in a vertical
 *   run. The Dynamic Lug band is nearly case-wide where it attaches and
 *   tapers around the wrist.
 *
 * The wristband is worn on an invisible wrist directly behind the case (a
 * ~58 x 45 mm oval, the wrist a 46 mm watch is sold for). The Apple wears the
 * Solo Loop: one seamless stretchy band with no closure, no holes and no
 * hardware, flaring into the lug slots at both ends. The Galaxy wears a
 * two-strap band closing with a pin buckle and keeper on the underside.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.

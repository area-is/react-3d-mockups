/**
 * Apple Studio Display (2nd generation, 2026 - the 2022 enclosure carried
 * over): 27" 5K 5120x2880 at 218 ppi and 600 nits, 623 x 478 x 168 mm on the
 * tilt-adjustable stand, a ~19.5 mm flat-back aluminum slab standing 362 mm
 * bare (Apple's own VESA-configuration height), all-glass front with a uniform
 * ~13 mm black bezel over only a hairline of aluminum, centered camera,
 * 2x Thunderbolt 5 + 2x USB-C in a tight rear row left of center seen from
 * behind, the captive power cord's circular inlet centered low on the back,
 * and no power button.
 *
 * Every number below is measured off Apple's own imagery rather than
 * eyeballed: the official side-view illustration from the stand-adjustment
 * support guide (its 761 px height scales exactly to the published 478 mm, so
 * one pixel is 0.629 mm) for the profile, and the 2026 rear and front product
 * shots (panel width 623 mm as the ruler) for everything on the back.
 * Normalized to ~115 mm per world unit, so the enclosure is 5.42 units wide.
 * Origin sits at the panel center; the desk plane is `standHeight` below it.
 *
 * The tilt stand is a 152.5 mm wide, 6.5 mm thin sheet arm hanging from its
 * hinge 89 mm below the panel center - the machined pivot caps show on the
 * arm's sides - leaning 13° back over a long, thin (6.9 mm) foot plate whose
 * rounded ends reach 66 mm ahead of the panel and 101 mm behind it: the
 * published 168 mm depth, with the arm landing near the plate's rear on small
 * fillets rather than a heel. A single vertical stadium cutout passes clean
 * through the arm straddling the enclosure's bottom edge: the panel's round
 * power inlet shows through its upper half (the dark circle in the rear
 * photography) and the lower half is open air the captive cord drops through.
 *
 * This is pure, renderer-agnostic data: the 3D model consumes it today and a
 * future 2D (CSS/SVG) renderer can consume the same numbers.

/**
 * Book-fold device dimensions - the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the Galaxy Z Fold 8, the
 * Galaxy Z Fold 8 Ultra, and Apple's iPhone Duo.
 *
 * A book-fold foldable has two form factors, and this spec carries both so the
 * one device can render either:
 *
 * - `closed`: the folded candy-bar - a narrow, thick body with a tall cover
 *   display on the front, the camera pill on the back and the hinge spine
 *   capping the left edge.
 * - `open`: the unfolded tablet - a wide, thin body with the large, nearly
 *   square inner display (a faint crease runs down its center) and the
 *   recessed hinge spine on the back.
 *
 * Both share one world scale (the same ~36.66 mm per unit as the Galaxy phone
 * family) so a Fold sits at true relative size beside the S-series. Detail
 * geometry (buttons, camera plateau + pill, hinge, ports) was measured from
 * published specifications and product photography. Pure, renderer-agnostic data.
 *
 * Real Galaxy Z Fold 7: unfolded 158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2 mm (8.0" 2184x1968 inner,
 * ratio ~1.11); folded 158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9 mm (6.5" 2520x1080 cover, ratio ~2.32).
 * Real Galaxy Z Fold 8 Ultra: the same chassis to the published tenth of a
 * millimetre, 4.1 mm thin unfolded, with a 2504x2256 inner panel in the same
 * 8.0" diagonal. Real Galaxy Z Fold 8: the generation's new WIDE form factor -
 * folded a short, broad 123.9 x 81.9 x 9.7 mm bar (5.5" 1248x1972 cover),
 * unfolded a landscape 123.9 x 161.4 x 4.5 mm tablet whose 7.6" 2448x1848
 * inner panel is natively 4:3 landscape. The hinge still runs vertically, so
 * the same spec shape carries it; it is simply wider than it is tall.
 * Real iPhone Duo: the same passport shape - folded 117.8 x 84.1 x 11.3 mm
 * (5.4" 1398x2034 cover), unfolded a landscape 117.8 x 164.6 x 5.2 mm tablet
 * with a 7.6" 2670x1878 inner panel and no inner camera hole at all. It is
 * a different brand on the same spec shape: `brand` picks the marks and the
 * system chrome, and the Duo simply leaves out the Samsung-only parts.

 * unfolding around the same vertical hinge into a landscape
 * 117.8 x 164.6 x 5.2 mm tablet whose 7.6" 2670x1878 inner panel is natively

 *
 * What makes it an iPhone rather than a Galaxy on the same spec shape:
 *
 * - No inner camera hole. The inner FaceTime camera sits under the display,
 *   so `open.punchHole` is absent and the open pose is one clean panel. The
 *   outer 12 MP Center Stage camera is a centred hole in the cover screen.
 * - Two rear cameras (48 MP Fusion main and ultra wide) in the iPhone 17's
 *   own vertical glossy pill at the top of the camera half - the pill's
 *   size, corner clearance, lens pitch and flash placement are the 17's
 *   dimensional drawing transposed onto this half, since Apple has not
 *   published the Duo's own; the pill and its lens seat are one body-colour
 *   glass pedestal rather than the Galaxy's two-tone plateau and island.
 * - Touch ID in the side button: volume up, volume down and the side button
 *   ride the camera half's free rail, no Camera Control.
 * - A bare, micro-blasted 3D-printed hinge cover with no wordmark, and the
 *   Apple badge on the camera half's back below the pill.
 * - A mirror-polished grade 5 titanium frame (`brand: 'apple'` is what the
 *   renderer keys the finish and iOS's status bar off).
 *
 * Resolutions are Apple's exact point grids at 3x: 890x626 inner (given as
 * the unrotated landscape width, as the Fold 8's is), 466x678 cover. Key
 * positions, the antenna seam and the bottom-edge machining are adapted
 * from the Fold 8 and the slab iPhones' rails pending Apple's accessory
 * drawings for the Duo.

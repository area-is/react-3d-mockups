 *
 * Why a screen ever paints smaller than it is declared: Chromium rasterizes a
 * layer at a scale derived from the transform that draws it, but a transform
 * with PERSPECTIVE has no meaningful 2d scale, so it falls back to the device
 * scale factor - and the HTML bridge puts every screen under a CSS
 * `perspective`. A 1512x982 laptop display is therefore rasterized at
 * 1512x982 x dpr REGARDLESS of how small the mockup is on the page: 4536x2946
 * device pixels on a 3x phone, ~53 MB of tile memory, for a screen occupying
 * perhaps 120 pixels of it. Past the compositor's tile budget the tiles it
 * cannot afford are simply never rasterized, and they composite as holes - the
 * blank rectangles that appear over a phone's mockup screens, and that a drag
 * brings back because moving the layer re-prioritizes every tile.
 *
 * The bound is the canvas: a screen is drawn INTO the mockup canvas, so it can
 * never be shown larger than the canvas is, and painting it at more device
 * pixels than the canvas has can add no detail. Scaling until the painted
 * layer just covers the canvas keeps the screen sampled at or above 1:1 at any
 * pose while cutting tile memory by the square of the step - the 3x phone
 * above drops to 1134x738, ~3 MB.
 *
 * Returns 1 whenever the display is already smaller than the canvas can show,
 * which is every desktop-density case; only a high-DPI viewport small enough
 * for the fallback to over-rasterize steps down.

GPU-accelerated **3D device mockups for React** - drop any content onto the screen of a
3D phone and it renders live: real DOM on the glass, vector crisp at any angle, videos
playing, iframes loading. The mockups are decorative - you rotate and zoom them, and the
hardware masks the screen pixel for pixel.

Built on [three.js](https://threejs.org) and
[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). Every model is
generated procedurally at runtime - **no 3D asset files to load or host**. The device
lineup is 27 strong: the Galaxy S26 line, two foldable generations (Z Fold 7 and
Z Flip 7, the wide Z Fold 8, the Z Fold 8 Ultra and Z Flip 8), the
iPhone 17 family, MacBook Air and Pro, the iPad and Galaxy Tab families, an Apple
Watch and three Galaxy Watches (8, 9 and the titanium Ultra 2) on full wristbands,
and a 27" desktop display. Beyond devices,
the same live-surface API covers everyday objects - books, magazines,
brochures, cards, packaging (product box, mailer box, gable-top milk carton,
shopping bag),
custom-size panels and boxes at any millimeter dimensions, posters, vinyl
records, out-of-home formats (billboard, bus shelter, double-sided DOOH totem,
A-frame, roll-up banner, storefront), a 65" TV, and wrap-ready vehicles (transit
bus, cargo van, 53 ft semi trailer).

```tsx
'use client'

import { GalaxyMockup } from 'react-3d-mockups'

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <GalaxyMockup autoRotate float>
      <YourApp /> {/* any React node, iframe, video… */}
    </GalaxyMockup>
  )
}
```

Every device and object has its own page with a live prop explorer.

## Monorepo layout

| Path | npm name | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`packages/react`](packages/react) | `react-3d-mockups` | The published npm package - the whole library |
| [`apps/docs`](apps/docs) | - | Next.js docs & live demos site |

Inside the package, `src/core` holds the specs, geometry math and screen/stage
behavior, depends on `three` and never imports React; the rest of `src` is the
react-three-fiber layer that renders it. Keeping the numbers out of the components is
what makes each mockup measurable and unit-testable without a renderer. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the layering rule.

## Development

Uses npm workspaces. Node 22+ required (wrangler, concurrently and vitest all
floor there). This is the toolchain for working *on* the repo - the published
package declares no `engines` and runs in the browser.

```bash
npm install        # installs all workspaces + builds the package (prepare hook)
npm run dev        # package in watch mode + docs at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # builds the package, then the docs site as a Worker bundle
npm run typecheck  # typechecks both workspaces
npm run test       # core unit tests (no DOM, no WebGL)
npm run visual     # visual regression vs baselines (needs `npm run dev` running)
npm run bench      # performance behaviour vs budgets (needs a running site)
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what each check catches; they overlap
less than they look.

## Releasing and deploying

- **The package** is published to npm from CI on a version tag, through npm
  Trusted Publishing; the very first publish is by hand. The steps are in
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing).
- **The docs site** runs on Cloudflare Workers (OpenNext), deployed by Workers
  Builds on push, and is served at a path on the apex. Everything about building,
  deploying and routing it - including the stand-in Worker for the `area.is` apex -
  is in [apps/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](apps/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

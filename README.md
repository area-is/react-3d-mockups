GPU-accelerated **3D device mockups for React** - drop any content onto the screen of a
3D phone and it renders live: real DOM on the glass, vector crisp at any angle, videos
playing, iframes loading. The mockups are decorative - you rotate and zoom them, and the
hardware masks the screen pixel for pixel.

Built on [three.js](https://threejs.org) and
[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). Every model is
generated procedurally at runtime - **no 3D asset files to load or host**. The device
lineup is 27 strong: the Galaxy S26 line, two foldable generations (Z Fold 7 and
Z Flip 7, the wide Z Fold 8, the Z Fold 8 Ultra and Z Flip 8), the
iPhone 17 family, MacBook Air and Pro, the iPad and Galaxy Tab families, an Apple
Watch and three Galaxy Watches (8, 9 and the titanium Ultra 2) on full wristbands,
and a 27" desktop display. Beyond devices,
the same live-surface API covers everyday objects - books, magazines,
brochures, cards, packaging (product box, mailer box, gable-top milk carton,
shopping bag),
custom-size panels and boxes at any millimeter dimensions, posters, vinyl
records, out-of-home formats (billboard, bus shelter, double-sided DOOH totem,
A-frame, roll-up banner, storefront), a 65" TV, and wrap-ready vehicles (transit
bus, cargo van, 53 ft semi trailer).

```tsx
'use client'

import { GalaxyMockup } from 'area-3d-mockups'

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <GalaxyMockup autoRotate float>
      <YourApp /> {/* any React node, iframe, video… */}
    </GalaxyMockup>
  )
}
```

## Monorepo layout

| Path | npm name | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`packages/react`](packages/react) | `area-3d-mockups` | The published npm package - the whole library |
| [`apps/docs`](apps/docs) | - | Next.js docs & live demos site |

Inside the package, `src/core` holds the specs, geometry math and screen/stage
behavior, depends on `three` and never imports React; the rest of `src` is the
react-three-fiber layer that renders it. Keeping the numbers out of the components is
what makes each mockup measurable and unit-testable without a renderer. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the layering rule.

## Development

Uses npm workspaces. Node 22+ required (wrangler, concurrently and vitest all
floor there). This is the toolchain for working *on* the repo - the published
package declares no `engines` and runs in the browser.

```bash
npm install        # installs all workspaces + builds the package (prepare hook)
npm run dev        # package in watch mode + docs at http://localhost:3000
npm run build      # builds the package, then the docs site as a Worker bundle
npm run typecheck  # typechecks both workspaces
npm run test       # core unit tests (no DOM, no WebGL)
npm run visual     # visual regression vs baselines (needs `npm run dev` running)
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what each check catches; they overlap
less than they look.

## Publishing the package

Releases go out from CI, triggered by a tag:

```bash
npm version patch -w area-3d-mockups   # or minor / major
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) publishes through npm
Trusted Publishing (OIDC), so there is no npm token in this repo, and it refuses any
tag that does not match the version in the manifest.

**The very first publish is the exception** and has to be done by hand, because npm
requires a package to exist before a trusted publisher can be attached to it:

```bash
cd packages/react
npm publish --access public
```

Then attach the publisher once. The command and its caveats are documented at the top
of `release.yml`. The `prepare` script builds `dist/` automatically before publish,
and the core is bundled into `area-3d-mockups`, so it is not published separately.

## Deploying the docs

The docs site runs on Cloudflare Workers through the
[OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) adapter. Config lives in
`apps/docs/wrangler.jsonc` and `apps/docs/open-next.config.ts`.

```bash
npm run preview:docs   # build + serve the real Worker locally (workerd, not next dev)
npm run deploy:docs    # build + deploy from your machine
```

`npm run dev` is still the fastest loop for day-to-day work; `preview:docs` is what to
run before trusting a deploy, since it executes the app in the Workers runtime rather
than Node.

### CI/CD

**Deploys** are [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/),
configured in the Cloudflare dashboard rather than in this repo. Cloudflare clones,
builds and deploys on push, under an API token it generates and holds itself, so there
are no deploy credentials in GitHub and no deploy workflow here.

The workflows that *are* here do everything else: `ci.yml` typechecks, tests and builds
every pull request, `release.yml` publishes to npm on a tag, and
`cloudflare-build-pr-comments.yml` reports each Workers build back onto its PR.

Settings live under **Workers & Pages → area-3d-mockups-docs → Settings → Build**:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Root directory | `apps/docs` |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Deploy command | `npx wrangler deploy` |
| Non-production branch deploy command | `npx wrangler versions upload` |
| Git branch | `main` |

Two things that are easy to get wrong:

- **The Worker's name in the dashboard has to be `area-3d-mockups-docs`**, matching
  `name` in `apps/docs/wrangler.jsonc`. A mismatch fails the build rather than
  deploying to the wrong place.
- **Root directory is `apps/docs`, not the repo root.** That is where the Wrangler
  config lives, which is what Cloudflare keys off. It works with npm workspaces
  because `npm ci` walks up to the root lockfile, installs every workspace, and runs
  the `prepare` hooks that build `packages/react/dist` before the docs build reads it.

Those are the stock Workers Builds commands, unedited. They land on OpenNext through
two indirections worth knowing about:

- **`npm run build` in `apps/docs` is `opennextjs-cloudflare build`, not `next build`.**
  Wrangler needs `.open-next/worker.js`, which a plain Next build never produces. The
  Next build survives as `build:next`, and `open-next.config.ts` sets that as OpenNext's
  `buildCommand`. Without it the adapter would fall back to its own default of
  `npm run build` and recurse into itself.
- **`wrangler deploy` re-executes itself as `opennextjs-cloudflare deploy`.** It detects
  an OpenNext project from a `next.config.*`, an `open-next.config.*` and an installed
  `@opennextjs/cloudflare`, then hands off. That hand-off is the seam where cache
  population would happen if `open-next.config.ts` ever gains an incremental cache.

`wrangler versions upload` has no such hand-off: it uploads the built Worker directly.
That is equivalent today, because the incremental cache is `dummy` and there is nothing
to populate. If that changes, the non-production command has to become an explicit
`opennextjs-cloudflare upload` rather than the default.

### Worker size

The bundle is about 3.9 MB gzipped, over the
[3 MB Workers Free ceiling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-size)
and well under the 10 MB paid one, so deploys need a Workers Paid account.

Shiki is the weight: around 400 TextMate grammars end up inlined in the Worker. They
get there because Next externalises `shiki`, so the whole package is traced into the
server bundle and OpenNext's esbuild pass inlines its full-bundle import map. Nothing
ever calls it at runtime, though. Every docs route is prerendered, `/api/search` is
Orama, and `components/code-block.tsx` is a plain `<pre><code>`, so the highlighted
HTML is baked in at build time and the grammars are dead code.

Two things that look like fixes but are not, both measured at 4035 KiB gzipped
against a 4036 KiB baseline:

- `rehypeCodeOptions.langs` in `source.config.ts`. It controls which grammars the
  highlighter *loads*, not which ones are reachable from the module graph.
- `outputFileTracingExcludes` in `next.config.ts`. OpenNext traces `@shikijs` in
  regardless.

What would work is shiki's [fine-grained bundle](https://shiki.style/guide/bundles):
`fumadocs-core/mdx-plugins/rehype-code.core` accepts a `ShikiFactory`, so a highlighter
built from `shiki/core` plus explicit `@shikijs/langs/{tsx,ts,bash}` imports never
references the full-bundle map that pulls the other ~397 in.
